# 🕊️ Towering(ish) Side effects
*A nerve racking 3D tower defense made for Bevy Jam 3.*

</div>

This game is a pretty normal tower defense. But when you upgrade your towers there is a chance to get some side effects. Sometimes reverting your upgrades or worse. 
All proportional to your greed :)

# Features
- Side effects (roughly) proportional to your greed and progress
- Loading pathing and data from GLTF
- Simple but quite hard to break enemies
